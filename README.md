## Platforms

By awesome hackathon platforms, we mean web or mobile applications that are specifically designed to run a hackathon, or which have effectively adapted for use in events of this type. They typically allow organizers to announce the schedule and topics, register participants, and document the results. In alphabetical order.

### Open Source

These can be run with a cloud provider or self-hosted, to take full control of the data. Being open source efforts, they typically embrace open standards. Several are developed by non-profits and volunteer communities.

Despite having a presence on GitHub, the core applications these companies operate their service on are closed-source projects, and are therefore marked with a lock icon (üîí).
